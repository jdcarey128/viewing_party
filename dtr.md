Group Member Names: Aidan Murray, Sean Steel, Joshua Carey 

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
- Aidan: learn how to properly consume complicated APIs
- Sean: learn how consume APIs, explore and conquer Travis CI, master self-referential relationship in AR
- Joshua: learn how to consume APIs, organize code effectively (following Rubocop code editor), make the switch to VS code 

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
- Aidan: Driver/navigator is not preference. Preference working alone or open to liveshare via vs code. Strengths include debugging.
- Sean: Strengths include attention to detail. Work preference includes mix of solo work and group checkins. 
- Joshua: Work preference divide and conquer with group check ins. Up for driver/navigator. Strengths include efficiency. 

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
- Cruise through project and debug issues as they arise relatively quickly.
